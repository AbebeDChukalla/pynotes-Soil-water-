# PyNotes for Plant and Soil Scientists

A hands-on set of python notebooks intended for students that have little or no programming experience and are interested in acquiring basic programming skills. The Python notes focus on understanding programming logic by developing codes for automating and increasing the reproducibility of common tasks in plant and soil sciences.
