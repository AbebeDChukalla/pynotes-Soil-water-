    "A simple Python version of the popular game show \"Let's Make a Deal\". The rules of the game are simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are three doors and the doors are closed\n",
    "- Behind one door there is a car and behind each of the remaining doors there is a goat\n",
    "- The player selects a door\n",
    "- The host reveals one of the doors containing a goat, which means that two doors remain closed (including the door selected by the player)\n",
    "- The host asks the player if he/she wishes to change the selection of his/her door\n",
    "- Player makes a decision whether he/she stays with the initial choice or selects the other door\n",
    "- Hosts reveals what is behind the door selected by the player\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important part of the game is when the host reveals the location of one of the goats. At this point the host is giving valuable information to the player. The player has the chance to exploit this new information by swapping the doors.\n"
