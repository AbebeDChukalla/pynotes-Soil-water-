    "* Variable pace to ensure that you understand a concept before moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Live coding sessions: risky, things may not work, we might need to stop, but the idea is to code an explain to you why I'm writing these lines.\n",

    "# Role of coding in my career (5 min)\n",
    "* Coding is one of the most important skills that I learned in gradaute school\n",
    "* Before coding I was locked into analysis of variance and significant differences. Coding enabled spatio-temporal analysis, numerical simulation of physically-based processes, curve fitting and parameter optimization\n",
    "* Coding forces you to think logically, break down a large problem into smaller steps, and requires attention about seemingly irrelevant details\n",
    "* Track the work and reasoning of students and colleagues. Underrated tool for advising\n",
    "* Create something out of thin air\n",
