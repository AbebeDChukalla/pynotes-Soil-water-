    "The `if` statements play a fundamental role controlling the logical flow of the code. A sequence of decision rules instruct the computer to execut specific commands. `If` statements evaluate whether a condition is `True` or `False`, and at that point the code bifurcates. Sometimes there are multiple conditions as part of a single `if` statement, in which the code could branch into many different options.\n"

Even numbers are divisible by 2 with a reminder of zero whereas odd numbers are not divisible by 2 and have remainder greater than zero. To perform this operation we can use the Python `modulo` operator, which represented by `%`."
