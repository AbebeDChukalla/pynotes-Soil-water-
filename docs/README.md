# PyNotes in Plant and Soil Sciences

>A hands-on set of python notes intended for students that have little or no programming experience and are interested in acquiring basic programming skills. The course focuses on understanding programming logic by developing codes for automating and increasing the reproducibility of common tasks in plant and soil sciences.

## Goals

- Tutorials with real data
- Learn basic python commands and good programming habits
- Implement reproducible research practices using Github and IPython notebooks
- Learn to import, process, and export data
- Generate publication quality figures
- Implement and optimize simple models
