# PyNotes for Plant and Soil Scientists

A set of hands-on coding exercises in Python focused on understanding programming logic by developing codes for automating and increasing the reproducibility of common tasks in disciplines that study the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum.

## Audience 

The notes were developed for gradaute students in environmental science, soil science, and agronomy programs with little or no programming experience, but anyone interested in learning how to code and with sufficient discipline to follow along the notes should find this content useful. 

The Python language was selected because of its simple syntax, vast adoption as a numerical software by the scientific community, and free availability. The code in these notes is intended to be simple and explicit, and code expressions may not be the most efficient or *pythonic* for advanced programmers.


## Motivation

This set of Python notes stems from the need to increase code literacy in students pursuing a career in environmental sciences and engineering. With the advent of technological advances and automated data collection systems, scientific computing is becoming a highly empowering skill for future scientists immersed in a digital era. This content is aimed at the next generation of researchers so that they can be more productive, work faster, handle large datasets, generate reproducible science, develop more creative data analysis and interpretation skills, and develop code for self-teaching concepts and processes in environmental science.

Part of the driving force for creating this material originates from the lack of online examples including real datasets. The material presented in this series of Jupyter notebooks relies entirely on data collected for published research studies in peer-reviwed journals or data collected by the author and his students.


## Goals

Students who successfully complete the material should be able to:

- construct effective, well documented, and error free scripts and functions.
- apply high-level programming to generate publication quality figures and optimize simple models.
- find information independently for self-teaching and problem solving.
- learn good programming habits and basic reproducible research practices by following short exercises using real data.
