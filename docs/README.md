# PyNotes in Plant and Soil Sciences

>A hands-on set of python notebooks intended for students that have little or no programming experience and are interested in acquiring basic programming skills. The notes focus on understanding programming logic by developing codes for automating and increasing the reproducibility of common tasks in plant and soil sciences.

## Goals

- Tutorials with real data
- Learn basic python 3 commands and good programming habits
- Implement reproducible research practices using Github and Jupyter notebooks
- Learn to import, process, and export data
- Generate publication quality figures
- Implement and optimize simple models


## About

Andres Patrignani is an assistant professor in soil water processes in the Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University. The code in these notes are intended to be simple and explicit, and code expressions may not be the most efficient or *pythonic* for advanced programmers.
